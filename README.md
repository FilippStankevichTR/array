# Array task

We are going to implement type Array which is a wrapper class over an array of integer numbers.

1. Implement constructors that allow us to create objects of this type in several ways;
2. Implement ``get`` and ``set`` methods for fields of this type;
3. Override methods of the class ``Object``(``toString()``, ``equals()``, ``hashCode()``). 

The program should support the following operations:

1. Sorting an array in three ways;
2. Search for an array item (use a binary search algorithm);
3. Search the ``max`` (maximum value) and ``min`` (minimum value) array items;
4. Get all the primes in the array ([Prime Number](https://www.splashlearn.com/math-vocabulary/algebra/prime-number));
5. Get all the Fibonacci numbers in the array ([Fibonacci Number](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Fibonacci+numbers));
6. Get all three-digit numbers with no identical digits in the decimal notation;
7. Support for three options for filling array items: from the console, from the file and using random number generation.
